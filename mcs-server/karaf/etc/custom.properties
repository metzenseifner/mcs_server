######### KARAF CONFIGURATION #########

# The place for Karaf to put the lock file ensuring that MCS is not run twice at the same time.
karaf.lock.dir=${karaf.data}

# Setting or deactivating the remote shutdown port in Apache Karaf. Commenting this out will make Karaf listen to a
# random shutdown port on localhost, announcing it via ${karaf.shutdown.port.file}. Setting this to -1 will deactivate
# the shutdown port. Note that the stop script is based on this and will not work any longer if the port is deactivated.
#karaf.shutdown.port=-1

# Specifies the location of the port file for MCS. It is used by the shutdown script to send the shutdown command
# to the main process.
#karaf.shutdown.port.file=${karaf.data}/port

# Command for shutting down MCS. If the shutdown port is enabled, MCS will listen for this command to initiate
# the shut down procedure.
# Change this to something secret
#karaf.shutdown.command=

# Specifies the location of the PID file for MCS. It is used by the shutdown script to synchronously shut down
# MCS as it will wait for the process with the given process id. Removing this will cause the network port to be
# used as fallback.
#karaf.pid.file=${karaf.data}/pid
